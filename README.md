Simple Timer
------------

A friend asked me to create a simple timer app, so I did. And I decided to post it here in case others might find it useful. The piece others might find most useful is the **KTStopwatch** class. This class is similar to the one I use in Labor Mate. It supports both a wall clock and an elapse timer.
